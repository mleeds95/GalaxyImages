100 kiloparsecs radius
G15784. snapshot
mugs.mcmaster.ca
physical units in pynbody
a = 1/(1+z), a is scale factor, z is redshift
first file is simulation info
-iord tells which particle (by unique id) is where in each file
-AHF is the halo finder that finds the galaxy in the simulation
-blue stars are younger, red are older
in galaxies, the dark matter, star particles and dust are the most important

Due to "ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10" errors when 
running sim.halos() (in _load_ahf_particle_block), I changed lines 
2 and 4290038 
in g15784.01024.z0.000.AHF_particles
useful AHF docs: http://popia.ft.uam.es/AHF/files/AHF.pdf
appears to be erroring here:
